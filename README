This is a collection of my homework assignments and projects of MATH 128B
(Numerical Analysis 2) at UC Berkeley. All the programs in this repository
are written in Matlab, but we can also run them on Octave.

The programs include:
1) Linear System Solvers
	- Gaussian elimination
	- Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP)
	- LU factorization
	- Cholesky factorization
	- Conjugate gradient method
	- Jacobi method
	- Gauss-Seidel method
	- Generalized minimal residual method (GMRES)
2) Least Squares
	- QR factorization using Gram-Schmidt process
	- QR factorization using Householder reflectors
3) Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
	- Rayleigh's quotient
	- Power iteration
	- Inverse power iteration
	- Rayleigh quotient iteration
	- simultaneous iteration
	- Pure QR algorithm
	- Bring a matrix into upper Hessenberg form
	- Shifted QR algorithm with deflation
	- Singular value decomposition (SVD)
4) Partial Differential Equations (P.D.E.)
	- One-dimensioal Heat Equation
		i. Forward difference method
		ii. Backward difference method
